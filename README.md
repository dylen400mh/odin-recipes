# odin-recipes
This webpage includes multiple recipes with in-depth instructions on how to make each dish. 

This project demonstrates the use of basic html and css skills, such as creating multiple pages with their own images and links, providing the user an interactive experience. In addition, html elements such as headers, paragraphs, and lists (ordered and unordered) are also included in the body of each page. Basic CSS is used to create a less bland style to the page. 

This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of the command line to manipulate the data in the project's repository and to push changes made to GitHub when applicable.
